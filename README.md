This assignment is the upgraded version of my Lab 2 portfolio. Here, I made the website **fully responsive** and added modern CSS features like **Flexbox, Grid, media queries, animations, and hover effects**.

## 🌟 What I Did

* Used **Flexbox** for the header and hero section (text + image layout).
* Used **CSS Grid** to display skills and projects in neat card layouts.
* Added **media queries** so the site works on mobile, tablet, and desktop.
* Used **relative units** (%, rem, vw/vh) for better scaling.
* Added hover effects on cards, buttons, and links.
* Added a smooth text animation for “Full Stack Developer” in the hero section.
* Improved spacing, colors, and typography for a clean and modern look.

## 🗂 Files Updated

* **index.html** – Now structured with clean sections.
* **style.css** – Contains Flexbox, Grid, animations, and responsive code.
* **images/** – Includes profile picture.

## 🖥 Final Output

The site now looks modern and works smoothly on all screen sizes. Cards animate slightly on hover, the hero text is animated, grids collapse responsively, and the layout feels clean and professional.

## 🚀 How to Run

Just open **index.html** in any browser. Resize the window to see the responsive behavior.
